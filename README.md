# Lance Leventhal's "6809 Assembly Language Programming"
This repository contains compilable example code and worked out
problems for Lance Leventhal's excellent book [6809 Assembly Language Programming](https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Books/6809%20Assembly%20Language%20Programming%20(Lance%20Leventhal).pdf).
All of the provided code was run on the [Motorola 6809 Emulator](https://6809.uk/) without error.

Most of the early examples and problems are trivial but they are
included for completeness. For the more difficult problems, I did
my best but I'd love pull requests to make this better. I also make
use of branching to subroutines before the concept is introduced,
e.g. [problem 8-5](chap08/problems/problem-8-5.asm?plain=1).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work-in-progress as I march through the book.
